\title{Gene-set Enrichment analysis on one term.}
\usage{
term_gsea(
  genes,
  scores,
  test = "wilcoxon",
  alternative = "greater",
  min_size = 3
)
}
\arguments{
\item{genes}{Character vector of gene IDs that belong to
a group to test.}

\item{scores}{Named numeric vector of gene scores to be tested.
The 'names' attribute must correspond to the values in `genes`.}

\item{test}{Which test to perform. Either 'wilcoxon' or 'ks'
for Wilcoxon Rank Sum and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests repsectiveley.
Test use R's base \link{wilcox.test} and \link{ks.test} respectiveley.}

\item{alternative}{The alternative hypothesis to test. Either 'greater',
'less' or 'two.sided'. It  corresponds to option 'alternative' in
\link{wilcox.test} or \link{ks.test}. Typically, if scores are p-values
one wishes to #' test the hypothesis that p-values within 'genes' are 'less'
than expected; while if scores are some other type of value (like
fold-change abundance) one is trying to test that those values are
'greater'. Keep in mind that the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is a test of the
maximum difference in cumulative distribution values. Therefore, an
alternative 'greater' in this case correspons to cases where
score is stochastially smaller than the rest.}

\item{min_size}{The minimum number of genes in the group for the test
to be performed. Basically if the number of genes that appear in
'scores' is less than 'min_size', the test won't be performed.}
}
\value{
If the test is not performed it returns NULL. If the test
is performed it returns a tibble with elements: size (the number 
of elements in both 'genes' and 'scores'), statistic (the statistic
calculated, depends on the test), and p.value (the p-value of the test).
}
\description{
Performs gene-set enrichment analysis on a group of genes.
Tests whether the scores among selected genes differ from
the overall score dsitribution.
}
\details{
The function currently doesn't check whether some genes in `genes`
are missing from `scores`. It will simply ignore those and test among
the `genes` found in scores.

\examples{
set.seed(123)
scores <- rnorm(n = 100)
names(scores) <- paste('gene', 1:100, sep = "")

# Select some genes and increase their scores
genes <- names(scores)[1:10]
scores[genes] <- scores[genes] + rnorm(10, mean = 1)

# Test
term_gsea(genes, scores)
term_gsea(genes, scores, test = 'ks', alternative = 'less')
